#IGME Atlas

To build and run the frontend locally on your computer, you will need node.js installed and added to your path.
Simply open the main directory in a shell application, run grunt. This will build the project to a build directory host the site locally, and open it in your browser.

We use two separate branches for this repository: master and dev.
The master branch contains only the build from our dev branch.
To update master to dev, clone master into a different location, copy any files in the dev build directory into that project, and push your changes to git. This will automatically update the live site on github.
